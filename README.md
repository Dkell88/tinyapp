# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). The application does require you to register and login before use. Once logged in users can view all shortened URLs that have been create and stored on the server. However, only short URLs that were created by the user can be edited or deletes.
